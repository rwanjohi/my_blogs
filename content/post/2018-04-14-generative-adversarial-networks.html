<ul>
<li><p>GAN consist of two competing models striving to outdo each other: the Generator and Discriminator models.</p></li>
<li><p>The Generator takes in random input and tries to generate real data (curves, images, texts, ).</p></li>
<li><p>The Discriminator is a binary classifier. It takes, as its input, the fake data generated by the Generator, and the real dataset and learn to tell whether the data is real or fake.</p></li>
<li><p>Through back propagation, the Generator updates its parameters using the output from the Discriminator.</p></li>
<li><p>The two models are trained simultaneously with the aim that the continuous competition will help produce data that is indistinguishable from the real data.</p></li>
</ul>
