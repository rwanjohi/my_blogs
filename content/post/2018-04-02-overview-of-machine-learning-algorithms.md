# Learning Styles:

* Supervised Learning
     + The values of target variable, in training set is known.
     
* Unsupervised Learning
     + data is not labeled and outcomes are unknown.
     + Seek to find hidden structure in unlabeled data 
     + Example: Clustering algorithms

* Semi-supervised Learning
     + Uses both labeled and unlabeled data to improve supervised learning.
     + Example: in Deep learning Generative models


# Problems:
* Classification problem: The target variable is qualitative (categorical/nominal)
   + Binary- Two possible outcomes only
      + e.g. Yes/No, 0/1
   + Multi-Class- More than 2 outcomes
      + e.g. Positive, Neutral or Negative  customer sentiment/feedback

* Regression problem: The target is quantitative (discrete or continuous) 
   + Can take any real number in Real line
      + e.g. Stock prices, estimated revenue, interest rates, price of house, Number of accidents 

   
### Others:
* Clustering
* Dimension reduction
