* GAN consist of two competing  models striving to outdo each other: the Generator and Discriminator models.
  
* The Generator takes in random input and tries to generate real data (curves, images, texts, \ldots).
 
* The Discriminator is a binary classifier. It takes, as its input, the fake data generated by the Generator, and the real dataset and learn to tell whether the data is real or fake.
 
* Through back propagation, the Generator updates its parameters using the output from the Discriminator.

* The two models are trained simultaneously with  the aim that the continuous  competition will help produce data that is indistinguishable from the real data.
