# Problems:
* Classification: The target variable is qualitative (categorical/nominal)
   + Binary- Two possible outcomes only
      + e.g. Yes/No, 0/1
   + Multi-Class- More than 2 outcomes
      + e.g. Positive, Neutral, Negative  customer sentiment/feedback

* Regression: The target is quantitative (discrete or continuous) 
   + Can take any real number in Real line
      + e.g. Stock prices, estimated revenue, interest rates, price of house, Number of accidents 

   
# Others:
* Clustering
* Dimension reduction


Some notations:\\
* M: Number of predictors/features/ independent variables
* N: Number of records/rows/observations/instances
* n: sample size
