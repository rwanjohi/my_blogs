# Problems:
* Classification: The target variable is qualitative (categorical/nominal)
   + Binary- Two possible outcomes only
      + e.g. Yes/No, 0/1
   + Multi-Class- More than 2 outcomes
      + e.g. Positive, Neutral, Negative  customer sentiment/feedback

* Regression: The target is quantitative (discrete or continuous) 
   + Can take any real number in Real line
      + e.g. Stock prices, estimated revenue, interest rates, price of house, Number of accidents 

   
# Others:
* Clustering
* Dimension reduction

***

Before we proceed here are some notations:
* M: Number of predictors/features/ independent variables
* N: Number of records/rows/observations/instances
* n: sample size 


# Linear Regression:

* For continuous target variable
* Relationship between the  target and predictors variables is established by fitting a best line fit

$$
 y = b_{0} + b_{1}x_{1} + b_{2}x_{2}+ \cdots     b_{m}x_{m} 
$$
*Pros:
  + Simple, easy to understand
  + Works most of the cases
